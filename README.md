# Work Day Planner

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## **Description**

The focus of this project was to mainly use JQuery, Bootstrap and Moment JS to dynamically update the HTML and CSS.

A day planner where users can keep track of important events during their busy work schedule so that they can manage their time effectively. The text area rows change colors corresponding to whether the timeblocks are in the past, present or future. They are able to save or unsave their texts from the local storage. This makes it possible for the information to persist so that users are able to re-visit their day planner without worrying about losing their information.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, if you would like to open the application locally, you need to either open the index.html file and press the short cut "Alt+B" or left click over the file and click "Open in Default Browser" to view this application.
